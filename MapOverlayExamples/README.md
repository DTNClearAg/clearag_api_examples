# ClearAg-Examples
Collection of examples of how to use the [ClearAg API](https://www.clearag.com/).

For all examples you will need to use your own API access credentials. All files which use a ClearAg API endpoint should have a `license` global variable near the top of the code.
```javascript
var license = "?app_id=YOUR_ID_HERE&app_key=YOUR_KEY_HERE";
```
