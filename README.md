# ClearAg-API-Examples

A collection of code examples using the the [ClearAg APIs](https://clearag.com) seperated by the particular API it uses.

For all examples you will need to use your own API access credentials. All files which use a ClearAg API endpoint should have a `license` global variable near the top of the code.
```javascript
var license = "?app_id=YOUR_ID_HERE&app_key=YOUR_KEY_HERE";
```
